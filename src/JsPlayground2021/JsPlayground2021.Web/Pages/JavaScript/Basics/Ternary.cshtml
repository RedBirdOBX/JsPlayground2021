    A ternary operator is a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. This works
    just like an if, else statement and is great for value assignments.  You can only assign values, you cannot have blocks
    of complicated code within.

<div class="my-3">
    let {variable} = (some T/F test) ? {true value} : {false value};
</div>

let voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough" ;
