    The indexOf() also works with arrays. You can use it to determine if something is found within an array. If it is NOT
    found, it will return a -1. "0" is actually the very first position (zero based) so it's possible o is return as a
    positive test.

    <h3 class="text-danger" id="demo"></h3>
</div>

<pre>
<code>
    // The result of a will be “2” meaning that "Apple" is located at position 2 in the array.
    let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let a = fruits.indexOf("Apple");
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a;
</code>

@section Scripts
{
    <script>
        // The result of a will be “2” meaning that "Apple" is located at position 2 in the array.
        let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let a = fruits.indexOf("Apple");
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a;
    </script>
